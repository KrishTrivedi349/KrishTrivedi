      <p id="deepCleanTxt">
        With our deep cleaning service, we start with six basic tasks. Once we've completed those, we move on to tackling a few room-specific chores. Our deep cleaning services comes in handy before you host company or when daily clutter and messes have started to pile up. You can also get our deep cleaning service as as part of your annual cleaning regimen in the spring or fall. Soon you'll have a clean and tidy place that can pass a white-glove inspection.
      </p>

      <img src="../images/deepClutter.jpg" alt="Before and After Clearing Cultter" id="deepClutter">
      <p id="deepClutterTxt">
        The first thing we do is find a new place for your furniture or with your permission get rid of any visible clutter that does not belong in the room. We save the stuff behind closed doors for another day to help simplify our deep cleaning service. Clearing clutter makes deep cleaning easier and seeing those tidy surfaces makes you happy.

      <p id="deepCeilingTxt">
        We tackle large, hard-to-reach surfaces first in this order: ceiling, ceiling trim, ceiling light fixtures (including bulbs), walls, the rest of the trim, and baseboards. We use a clean microfiber mop  or a duster with a telescoping handle to get the best results for these surfaces. Surfaces closer to the floor tend to build up dirt and dust, so we use warm water mixed with a specialized soap. In bathrooms, add a splash of white vinegar to the mixture to stop mold and mildew. For spots where using a mop is awkward or inconvenient, we use a microfiber cloth. Then, we rinse often and wring thoroughly.

      <p id="deepFurPolishTxt">
        Next we wipe all remaining hard surfaces (wood furniture, shelves, built-ins, etc.) using furniture cleaner and polish and a soft cloth. Finally, we take a lint roller to the lampshades.

      <p id="deepMoveFurTxt">
        Lastly, we move the furniture, even larger pieces like beds and sofas. To make moving heavy pieces easier, we place furniture slides under the legs of big pieces. We then break out our vacuum's crevice tool to get at the dirt in corners and along baseboards. If you have a hard floor, we clean it with a microfiber mop and the appropriate cleaner for the surface. If you have carpet, we clean it in a specialized way.
