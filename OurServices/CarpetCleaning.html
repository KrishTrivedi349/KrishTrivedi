        Once we are satisfied that the vacuum has picked up everything it can, we start your carpet cleaning. We want your carpets to be completely dry before moving furniture back into place or walking on them. So we position an oscillating fan where it can help to circulate air over the carpet or open the windows if the weather allows.
