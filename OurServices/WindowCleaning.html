         We start by removing dust from the window frame, tracks and sill with a vacuum, duster, brush, or a cloth. We do the same thing with your blinds or shades. If you have curtains, can we remove them and wash them, following the care instructions.

          If you have screens, we will remove them and vacuum or brush them to get rid of dust. If you think they need a deeper clean we can wash them with a warm, sudsy mix, then rinse and allow them to dry completely.

          Only after we have completed these steps we start to spray your windows with a generous amount of glass cleaner. Then, using a lint-free paper towel or microfiber cloth, wipe your windows from top to bottom and do the same thing again after putting on glass cleaner with a window squeegee. If we see any streaks, we give them another wipe until the glass is clear. For the outside, we wipe your windows and frames with a soft brush or disposable cloth to remove loose dirt and dust, and then repeat what we did inside.
